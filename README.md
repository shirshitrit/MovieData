## Overview

Welcome to the **Movie Data Analysis** project! This project is dedicated to analyzing movie industry trends by examining data from a given dataset. The goal is to uncover insights related to movie performance, box office revenue, and key influencing factors such as genre, actors, and directors. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we aim to present findings that help understand patterns and make data-driven recommendations.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes detailed information on movies, including:

- **Title**
- **Release Date**
- **Director**
- **Lead Actors**
- **Genres**
- **Budget & Box Office Revenue**

**Primary Dataset:** `MovieData.xlsx`

## Tools 

To process and analyze the movie data, the following tools were used:

- **Microsoft Excel** – Data analysis and visualization using pivot tables
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before performing an in-depth analysis, data preprocessing was necessary. The key steps included:

1. **Loading & Inspecting Data** – Reviewing structure and identifying inconsistencies
2. **Handling Errros and Missing Values** – Filling or removing incomplete records

## Exploratory Data Analysis

To derive meaningful insights, we focused on:

- Identifying **top-grossing movies**
- Analyzing **genre popularity trends**
- Examining **director & actor influence** on movie performance
- Comparing **budget vs. revenue** trends
- Understanding **seasonal impacts** on box office performance

## Results & Insights

### Key Findings:

1. **Action & Comedy movies** consistently generate higher box office revenue compared to other genres.
2. Worst month to release a movie is april, best season is spring to summer.
4. Higher budgets do not always guarantee higher profits.

## Challenges in Analysis:

The main challenge was ensuring the connections between the dashboard components were aligned correctly. For example, sliders needed to be set up so they wouldn’t interfere with the logic of other elements, like ensuring that filtering by genres didn’t affect a graph showing the best genres by box office.
